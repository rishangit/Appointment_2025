## Appointment Status Migration

This migration updates the appointment status workflow to match the new business logic.

### New Status Workflow

**Before:**
- `scheduled` â†’ `confirmed` â†’ `completed`/`cancelled`

**After:**
- `pending` â†’ `scheduled` â†’ `completed`/`cancelled`

### Status Mapping

| Old Status | New Status | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| `scheduled` | `scheduled` | Appointments accepted by companies |
| `confirmed` | `scheduled` | Merged into scheduled (company acceptance) |
| `completed` | `completed` | Finished appointments |
| `cancelled` | `cancelled` | Cancelled appointments |
| `*` | `pending` | New appointments created by users |

### Running the Migration

1. **Backup your database** (recommended):
   ```bash
   cp database/appointments.db database/appointments_backup.db
   ```

2. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/runMigration.js
   ```

3. **Verify the migration**:

   sqlite3 database/appointments.db "SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM appointments GROUP BY status;"
   ```

### What the Migration Does

1. âœ… Creates new appointments table with updated schema

   ```

2. Update the frontend to use old status values
3. Update backend models to use old status logic

### Frontend Updates Required

After running this migration, update your frontend components to:

1. Use the new `AppointmentStatus` enum
2. Handle `pending` status for new appointments
3. Update status change logic (pending â†’ scheduled)
4. Remove references to `confirmed` status

### Backend Updates Required

The following files have been updated:

- âœ… `backend/config/db.js` - Updated schema
- âœ… `backend/models/Appointment.js` - Updated queries
- âœ… `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Updated enum

### Testing

After migration, test the following workflows:

1. **User creates appointment** â†’ Status should be `pending`
2. **Company accepts appointment** â†’ Status should change to `scheduled`
3. **Company completes appointment** â†’ Status should change to `completed`
4. **Either party cancels** â†’ Status should change to `cancelled`
